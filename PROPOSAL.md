# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Manoel J-N
       
# Intentions:

Create a Processing Project that will hide a black & white image inside of a larger image, as well as reveal hidden messages created with the program
    
# Intended usage:

## encode:
makefile, tags to add a image to enode and the image to encode into

## decode:
makefile, tags to add the image that will be decoded, will then popup the decoded image
  
# Technical Details:

Uses processing, bit modifying/shifting
   
Using bit shifting to hide an black/white image in the last 3 bytes of the each of the rgb channels
processing to modify the image and save modified images
  
    
# Intended pacing:

start processing- setup tags
